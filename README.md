# Audio-Clone
This project aimms to develop human voice which would be corelated to the training audio and would use different speech features to generate human voice. We would be using GAN to train our model and the GAN example has been implemented in the audio clone ipynb file. 
Currently the code is trained to generate images of digits and the model is tained on the mnist dataset for digits.
